# Schematic
A language written by someone who has no idea how to write a language!

## What's it written in?
C

## What's it look like?
[Check it out!](src/schematic/test.sch)

## Is this a LISP?
Kinda sorta. Working on defining the syntax better but I want a more lispy
python so that's what I'm shooting for. Vague? You bet!

## Oh God, Why?
Because bored engineers need to have fun sometimes.
